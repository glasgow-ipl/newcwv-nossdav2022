Issue: Browser gives CORS blocking error.
Resolution: Make sure all served files are fetched from the same origin.

Issue: Simulation hung on (non-first run).
Resolution: Sometimes Firefox fails to fire playback finished event, which is required in order to successfully terminate the experiment.
It happens in only 2 or 3% of the runs so it is hard to debug. Resolution is to:
1. terminate the simulation manually
2. delete the simulation directory rooted in logs/
3. run ```mn -c``` in order to enable mininet to recover from the forceful shutdown
4. run ```make``` again
