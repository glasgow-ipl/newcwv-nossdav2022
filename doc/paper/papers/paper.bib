    abstract = {Despite known QoE shortcomings, Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) has been tied with TCP for many years now. The advent of HTTP/2 powered by transport protocols such as QUIC provides an excellent opportunity to revisit adaptive bitrate streaming with respect to QoE. QUIC promises improved congestion control, zero-RTT connection establishment and multiplexing logical streams. In this work, we adapt state-of-the-art DASH players with buffer-based and hybrid (rate/buffer-based) quality adaptation logic to use QUIC. Our main focus lies in contrasting the QoE performance of DASH algorithms running on top of QUIC versus TCP in various environments. Interestingly, we find through testbed and Internet measurements that QUIC does not provide a boost to current DASH algorithms but instead a degradation in the chosen quality bitrates.},

@article{Bae-2015-why-is-http-streaming-hard,
    abstract = {HTTP adaptive streaming is increasingly popular in video delivery. This is mainly because HTTP allows easy deployment while it simplifies content delivery, and chunk-based delivery enables dynamic adaptation of video quality to varying network bandwidth. However, we find that the very nature of chunk delivery on HTTP causes some fundamental problems in efficient bandwidth utilization. In this work, we investigate why it is so hard to adapt to varying bandwidth with HTTP adaptive streaming. First, we find that the choice of chunk duration greatly affects the bandwidth adaptation logic. Second, we observe that the disparity between the advertised quality of a chunk and real encoding rate confuses the client-side adaptation logic. Third, the dependence on TCP/HTTP leads to suboptimal bandwidth utilization while it makes it challenging to adapt to rapidly-changing bandwidth. We show the evidence of the problems in our controlled experiments with popular HTTP adaptive streaming schemes, and lay out the future requirements for robust bandwidth adaptation in video streaming.

    abstract = {With companies such as Netflix and YouTube accounting for more than 50% of the peak download traffic on North American fixed networks in 2015, video streaming represents a significant source of Internet traffic. Multimedia delivery over the Internet has evolved rapidly over the past few years. The last decade has seen video streaming transitioning from User Datagram Protocol to Transmission Control Protocol-based technologies. Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) has recently emerged as a standard for Internet video streaming. A range of rate adaptation mechanisms are proposed for DASH systems in order to deliver video quality that matches the throughput of dynamic network conditions for a richer user experience. This survey paper looks at emerging research into the application of client-side, server-side, and in-network rate adaptation techniques to support DASH-based content delivery. We provide context and motivation for the application of these techniques and review significant works in the literature from the past decade. These works are categorized according to the feedback signals used and the end-node that performs or assists with the adaptation. We also provide a review of several notable video traffic measurement and characterization studies and outline open research questions in the field.},

@inproceedings{Arun-2018-copa,
    abstract = {This paper introduces Copa, an end-to-end congestion control algorithm that uses three ideas. First, it shows that a target rate equal to 1/($\delta$d q), where d q is the (measured) queueing delay, optimizes a natural function of throughput and delay under a Markovian packet arrival model. Second, it adjusts its congestion window in the direction of this target rate, converging quickly to the correct fair rates even in the face of significant flow churn. These two ideas enable a group of Copa flows to maintain high utilization with low queuing delay. However, when the bottleneck is shared with loss-based congestion-controlled flows that fill up buffers, Copa, like other delay-sensitive schemes, achieves low throughput. To combat this problem, Copa uses a third idea: detect the presence of buffer-fillers by observing the delay evolution , and respond with additive-increase/multiplicative decrease on the $\delta$ parameter. Experimental results show that Copa outperforms Cubic (similar throughput, much lower delay, fairer with diverse RTTs), BBR and PCC (significantly fairer, lower delay), and co-exists well with Cubic unlike BBR and PCC. Copa is also robust to non-congestive loss and large bottleneck buffers, and outperforms other schemes on long-RTT paths.},

@inproceedings{Spiteri2016,
abstract = {Modern video players employ complex algorithms to adapt the bitrate of the video that is shown to the user. Bitrate adaptation requires a tradeoff between reducing the probability that the video freezes and enhancing the quality of the video shown to the user. A bitrate that is too high leads to frequent video freezes (i.e., rebuffering), while a bitrate that is too low leads to poor video quality. Video providers segment the video into short chunks and encode each chunk at multiple bitrates. The video player adaptively chooses the bitrate of each chunk that is downloaded, possibly choosing different bitrates for successive chunks. While bitrate adaptation holds the key to a good quality of experience for the user, current video players use ad-hoc algorithms that are poorly understood. We formulate bitrate adaptation as a utility maximization problem and devise an online control algorithm called BOLA that uses Lyapunov optimization techniques to minimize rebuffering and maximize video quality. We prove that BOLA achieves a time-average utility that is within an additive term O(1/V) of the optimal value, for a control parameter V related to the video buffer size. Further, unlike prior work, our algorithm does not require any prediction of available network bandwidth. We empirically validate our algorithm in a simulated network environment using an extensive collection of network traces. We show that our algorithm achieves near-optimal utility and in many cases significantly higher utility than current state-of-the-art algorithms. Our work has immediate impact on real-world video players and BOLA is part of the reference player implementation for the evolving DASH standard for video transmission.},
