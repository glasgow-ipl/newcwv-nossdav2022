In HTTP video streaming playback stability is an important metric contributing to the user's quality of experience. Throughput adaptive algorithms are known to achieve lower levels of playback stability than their buffer-based counterparts. New congestion window validation is a proposal aiming to keep the transport's transfer rate more stable. This paper shows how this reflects the playback stability. We find that while new congestion window validation stabilises the transfer rate in the transport layer this does not translate to a significant difference in the application's playback stability.

\section{Introduction}

% A good paper introduction is fairly formulaic. If you follow a simple set
% of rules, you can write a very good introduction. The following outline can
% be varied. For example, you can use two paragraphs instead of one, or you
% can place more emphasis on one aspect of the intro than another. But in all
% cases, all of the points below need to be covered in an introduction, and
% in most papers, you don't need to cover anything more in an introduction.
%


% Paragraph 1: Motivation. At a high level, what is the problem area you
% are working in and why is it important? It is important to set the larger
% context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger
% community?

Video playback stability is one of the key components contributing to user experience. Adaptive algorithms residing at the client are responsible for delivering high user experience. Adaptive algorithms are throughput or buffer based, or some combination of these. Throughput algorithms are known to achieve lower stability compared to their buffer-based counterparts.

% Paragraph 2: What is the specific problem considered in this paper? This
% paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. In the first
% paragraph you have established general context and importance. Here you
% establish specific context and background.

The adaptive algorithms face the difficult task of delivering video while picking its ``best'' representations at any given point in time. This is a complex task since these algorithms need to simultaneously fulfil multiple criteria including: high stability, high quality, and low video stalls. These criteria can often conflict one another. For example, an algorithm always picking the lowest available representation will achieve low video stall time and high stability (since representations will not fluctuate), however, it will also display lower video quality, whereas perhaps higher one was possible. In a dynamic network, achieving a high index on one of these criterion also comes at the cost of observing a lower index in another. Modern adaptive algorithms try to balance that trade-off. They use either the pre-buffered capacity at the client or the immediate network state as a heuristic to aid them in the decision process. The former algorithms are known as buffer and the latter as throughput based. 

In DASH's reference implementation, one of the main adaptive algorithms: ``throughput'' is known to have lower stability score compared to its alternatives. One reason for this might be because the underlying transport (e.g., TCP) does not transmit using a fixed rate. Recall TCP's ``sawtooth pattern'' shows the fluctuations in TCP's sending rate. Additionally, video over HTTP uses a single connection and exhibits idle periods (i.e., there is no useful information being exchanged) in-between video chunk transfers. During these idle periods, standard TCP practice is to ``validate'' the window by resetting its congestion state (the CWND variable). New Congestion Window Validation (New CWV) is a proposal that meant to keep more stable transfer rates in the presence of such idle periods.

% Paragraph 3: "In this paper, we show that...". This is the key paragraph
% in the introduction - you summarize, in one paragraph, what are the main
% contributions of your paper, given the context established in paragraphs
% 1 and 2. What's the general approach taken? Why are the specific results
% significant? The story is not what you did, but rather:
%  - what you show, new ideas, new insights
%  - why interesting, important?
% State your contributions: these drive the entire paper.  Contributions
% should be refutable claims, not vague generic statements.

In this paper we show whether New CWV's more stable rates at the transport layer translate into an increased video playback stability and more generally: increased video QoE. To test our hypothesis, we compare two video streams using TCP Reno. One with New CWV disabled (the current default) and one with it enabled. To measure video stability and overall QoE we collect standard video performance metrics: average bit-rate, bit-rate oscillation, and video stall time. To quantify the impact of New CWV with respect to the inferred network state at the client, we also record the immediate and smoothened client's throughput estimations for each delivered video chunk.

% Paragraph 4: What are the differences between your work, and what others
% have done? Keep this at a high level, as you can refer to future sections
% where specific details and differences will be given, but it is important
% for the reader to know what is new about this work compared to other work
% in the area.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies New CWV's effect with respect to the achieved QoE and video stability. Nazir et al. \cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash-newcwv} proposed New CWV and examined its effects in the transport layer, whereas we study its effect in the application layer. Other related work proposed new application algorithms to control video representation choices. We on the other hand evaluate a transport, not an application change and measure its impact on the video delivery. Finally, \cite{Bhat-2017-not-so-quic} consider replacing the transport protocol from TCP to QUIC for video delivery. 

% Paragraph 5: "We structure the remainder of this paper as follows." Give
% the reader a road-map for the rest of the paper. Try to avoid redundant
% phrasing, "In Section 2, In section 3, ..., In Section 4, ... ", etc.

We structure the remainder of this paper as follows. In section 2, we introduce previous work that motivates this paper, Section 3 describes our experimental setup. Section 4 discusses the obtained results. Chapter 5 lists other related work and finally chapter 6 concludes the paper.

% Idle periods longer than the RTO reset the CWND value. This forces TCP Reno to re-enter slow-start. Known as Congestion Window Validation (Figure \ref{fig:idle_cwnd_rto}). The effect of CWND validation in Reno and CWND is shown on Figure \ref{fig:idle_effect}.

% New CWV is a refinement of CWV that addresses the following issue.

% Throughput algorithms continuously measure the available bandwidth. High CWND fluctuations, (f.e., as a result of an RTO idle reset) could be picked up by the application algorithm. This could lead to requesting representations that are not fully using or overload network's available capacity. In either case, this would lead to an increased number of representation switches, which is shown to reduce user's QoE.


The problem of TCP not being designed to carry long bursty traffic, such as HTTP video is well known. Even before that, there were proposals to optimise TCP for application limited traffic \cite{rfc2861-2000-padhye-congestion-window-validation}.

In standard window based congestion control algorithms, the transfer is network bound if the sender is fully utilising its congestion window capacity. The behaviour of that is well known, (e.g., during the slow-start the window will double every RTT until it sees loss and during the congestion avoidance phase the window will increase by 1 MSS packet every RTT). However, not all applications that use TCP would fully use their window capacity. Those are then said to be application limited, f.e., the application does not have enough data to send with a rate that the network currently offers. It has been found that during such phases the RTT could grow unrealistically large, as for example, TCP would continue to grow the window by 1 every RTT until it sees loss. In cases where the application cannot send as fast as the network allows it, the chances of observing loss due to high sending rate are low.

Another issue might arise if the application sends data in bursts over the same connection. In such cases, the value that the internal TCP connection had for the window might not be representative of the network state anymore, depending on the duration of the idling period. For example, consider a single TCP application sending data over a 10Mbps link with no cross traffic. Then that connection could fully utilise the available capacity. But if the connection had began the transfer, then paused and during the pause two more such application joined the network. Then the fair share if the first application resumed would be 3.3Mbps, but its internal state might be closer to the previously measured capacity of 10.

To overcome these issues RFC 2861 - Congestion window validation (CWV) was proposed \cite{rfc2861-2000-padhye-congestion-window-validation}. It does not allow the congestion window to grow during application limited periods and re-sets the TCP state after an idle period longer than the connection's retransmission timeout (RTO) ,i.e., reduces the window down to its initial value and forces new slow-start.

Since its proposal RFC 2861 has been adopted by the Linux kernel. However, research found that while beneficial for the network, the TCP modifications proposed by that congestion window validation were sometimes too conservative \cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash-newcwv}. The authors discuss that particularly for HTTP adaptive streaming CWV negatively affects the stream performance, so they propose New Congestion Window Validation in RFC 7661 \cite{rfc7661-2015-fairhurst-new-cwnd-validation}. However, the authors show that New Congestion Window Validation normalises the TCP stream from the network's point of view and do not report on performance as seen by the application layer.

New Congestion Window Validation reuses the ideas of RFC 2861 with the main difference that it does not differentiate between application limited and long idle periods. It combines them in one state, which the authors call non-validated period. In it the congestion window will not grow beyond its slow-start threshold until the transfer becomes limited by the network or a loss is observed. Furthermore, New Congestion Window Validation does not allow this period to exceed 5 minutes. RFC 7661 has an experimental status and has not seen wide deployment.

The most notable difference between RFCs 2861 and 7661 is the reaction after an idle period (Figure \ref{fig:idle_effect}). An RFC 2861 validated connection would re-enter slow-start and thus temporary overwhelm the network to figure out the capacity limit. In contrast, an RFC 7661 connection would enter slow-start until it reaches its old slow-start threshold and begin congestion avoidance phase. For short bursty traffic such as video chunks in HTTP adaptive streaming. The lack of this initial window spike could mean more accurate capacity estimations for applications that performed this dividing the artifact's size by the transfer period.

In HTTP adaptive streaming's dash.js, the throughput algorithm does exactly that. Dash.js is a reference implementation provided by the DASH industry forum \cite{online-dashif}. The throughput algorithm is one of the three main adaptive strategies provided by dash.js. It is also currently a component of the default streaming strategy. In summary, the throughput algorithm selects appropriate bit-rate representation to request by measuring the throughput for the currently downloaded video chunks. It estimates the throughput by dividing the receive time by the size of the received element. Therefore, the throughput algorithm benefits greatly from having accurate bandwidth estimations. Currently, throughput is not the default strategy but a part of it, as relying solely on the bandwidth might force the player to switch to a lower representation much earlier than needed to reflect some temporary congestion on the link. However, the throughput algorithm is essential component of the current default strategy and also is being heavily used for streams that cannot provide sufficient buffer ahead of time (e.g., live-streaming). Therefore, improving the performance of the throughput algorithm benefits the whole streaming ecosystem.

\begin{itemize}
    \item This means that using New Congestion Window Validation, it could obtain more accurate results.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiment}

To evaluate whether New CWV results in more accurate bandwidth measurements and to assess their impact on the application layer, we design an experiment, using dumbbell topology. We then use one of the far ends as the server and the other as the client. The server is Nginx, the client is Firefox (v 91) using dash.js 3.1.3. The adaptation algorithm is set to throughput. This is chosen to maximise the impact of variable bandwidth measurements. Even though the current default algorithm uses a combination of throughput and buffer heuristics to decide which video chunk to request, the throuhgput algorithm is still a vital part of the default algorithm and is heavily leveraged for lower latency scenarios. Therefore, influencing the throughput algorithm's performance also has a direct impact on the current default's performance and could span novel lower latency solutions.

The RTT of the connection is 40 ms average value that measured from our residential network to a Netflix CDN. The routers' queues are set equal to the bandwidth delay product.

For bandwidth profiles, we chose capacities representative of DSLv2, FTTC, and FTTP as reported in the United Kingdom \cite{online-ofcom-report} (Table \ref{tab:experiments-network}).

Two distinct simulation instances are run each time: one using TCP Reno but not New Congestion Window Validation. The other one also uses TCP Reno but has New Congestion Window Validation enabled as well. To eliminate noise, we run each such instance 5 times before averaging and reporting the results.

The streamed video is Blender's Big Buck Bunny \cite{online-bbb}. Details in \ref{tab:experiments-video}

Finally, we modify the Linux kernel's timestamp reporting precision instruct it to use RFC 3339.

From application's point of view, during each simulation we collect the client's bandwidth estimations, so we can check our hypothesis. Additionally, we report standard video performance metrics: average bit-rate, average bit-rate oscillations, re-buffer ratio to quantify the achieved video quality of experience \cite{Spiteri-2019-from-theory-to-practice-sabre, Yin-2015-a-control-theoritic-approach, Dobrian-2013-understanding-the-impact-of-video-quality}.

In addition, we run tcpdump and record all packets on the client and the server, so we can reconstruct the network activity.

We expect that the profiles using New Congestion Window Validation will have better defined and denser clusters of the available link capacity, as measured by the client while connections not using New Congestion Window Validation will not be able to always accurately measure the link capacity. This would result in a more sparse and weaker confidence interval. We expect to observe less accurate measurements for video chunk requests immediately following an idle period. This is because standard TCP Reno re-sets its congestion window and slow start threshold states once such inactive period is detected.

\todo{Results}

% Additionally, Figure \ref{fig:throughput-precise-FTTP} shows one of the effects of the better defined transmission periods for New CWV. On the figure New CWV displays tighter confidence interval on the measured throughput, whereas Reno's inferred values vary more. This behaviour follows directly from Reno's irregular intervals. Varying the transmission time for chunks of same length, naturally translates to less confident bandwidth probes.


% However, we note that at the transport level New CWV results in more predictable sending patterns with better defined boundaries and more granular durations of the periods where the channel is in idle or sending period. For comparison, when not using New CWV these channels are irregular and do not follow a set of patterns. This might suggest that using New CWV, the traffic might be more stable in the presence of cross traffic or when multiple video clients are competing over the same bottleneck link. To demonstrate this, I will conduct a simulation where two clients request video on the DSL link. The results so far show that the client would start requesting the 1080 encoding as it is the highest sustainable for the 10 Mbps provided by DSL. The expected behaviour is that with two competing players both clients should carry on requesting 1080, as the combined bandwidth constraint remains lower than the capacity.

% \todo{ Simulation}

% \idea{Next, I am planning on investigating the effect of the idle periods.\\
% In specific:\\
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item How many idle periods are there during a simulation for a particular algorithm
%     \item How long are the idle periods on average; For how long is the connection idle, i.e., sum of all idle periods
%     \item What throughput is being reported before and after the idle period. Is the throughput before stable and the throughput after unstable? How long does it take to stabilise?
% \end{itemize}}



% To evaluate whether the hypothesis that more precise bandwidth estimations could improve streaming stability and to demonstrate to what extent inaccurate measurements contribute to playback instability when using the throughput algorithm we perform an experiment that emulates DSL and FTTC links.
% The link speeds were taken from Ofcom's ``Home Broadband Performance'' and FCC's ``Measuring broadband America'' annual reports (Table \ref{tab:experiments-network}). In all experiments the router queue size was set to the BDP for the connection and the latency was set at 50ms, reported by FCC and observed from our residential link to a Netflix's CDN.



% Experiment plan:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item New CWV achieves higher precision for obtained bandwidth probes
%     \item If we run an experiment with link speeds close to the required by the player New CWV should stabilise the requesting sooner than non New CWV connections.
%     \item Specific values for link speed and representation should not matter much as this behaviour would occur every time when link capacity is close to the player's request switching threshold. With current technologies this could occur for connections of up to 95 Mbps for 4k HDR video

% For all experiments, we stream a 635 second long SDR video from an Nginx server. The client is a Firefox instance using dash.js 3.1.3 using default parameters and "abrThroughput" as its adaptive strategy. We chose to set this strategy as it is one of the three current main ones and would best reflect the impact of accurate link capacity estimations. The video is encoded in 3 second chunks as prior work identified this gives the best trade-off in optimising network load, while minimising video stalls. 

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item CSP Notes
%     \item BBB video
%     \item different link types
% \end{itemize}

% Therefore using properties from the aforementioned scenarios, we propose a set of experiments with network characteristics as shown in Table \ref{tab:experiments-network}. The video is encoded as shown in Table \ref{tab:experiments-video}. The video duration is 635 seconds and we use the default dash.js settings for the throughput algorithm with video buffer length set to 12s (default). This means that after the client has buffered 12 seconds of video, we expect to see long on-off periods equal to the segment duration (3 seconds). As discussed earlier, the specific details of the link capacity and encodings do not matter but we have chosen these values as the link capacityies resemble DSL (experiment \#1) and FTTC (experiment \#2) links. The video encoding rates are taken from YouTube's reference values and the connection RTT is set to a value representative of reported latency on DSL links to a measurement site in US.

% We choose not to introduce cross traffic and change the link speed in order clear the observed results from any noise that could be introduces by either of these phenomena. Moreover, the scenario would be representative of a single user requesting video on a DSL connection.


% \subsection{Setup}

%     \item New CWV verification
%     \item Kernels
%     \item Adaptation algorithm
%     \item Network setup
% \end{itemize}
% }

% We would like to assess the effect that slow-start CWND spikes have with respect to the video's application performance. To demonstrate that, we compared Reno and New CWV as an example of two protocols, one affected by the issue and the other one non-affected by it.

% To carry that study, we wrote New CWV for Linux kernel 5.4.x series, as the previous implementation was for 3.8.x. Then we verified that our implementation is correct by validating it against the RFC. With that setup and exposing additional state from the DASH.JS adaptive algorithm, we were able to collect information about the players' throughput estimates. We then tested both algorithms for cases where the network capacity is: (i) close the required capacity by one of the video representations, (ii) between two different video representation requirements, and finally (iii) much more than the highest representation requirement.

% In cases where the link capacity is close to one of the representations, we expect it to either produce false positives or false negatives. Depending on whether the link capacity is under or over the required by the video representation. For cases that the link capacity is between two representation values, we do not expect to see significant difference, as a wrong bandwidth probe is likely to keep requesting the supported rate. Finally, for cases where the link capacity is much more than that required by the highest representation, we would again expect to see no difference as likely each video transfer would never exit the slow-start phase.

% Furthermore, as we expect New CWV would to produce different results compared to Reno in only one of those three cases the benefits of using New CWV would be proportional to how likely that issue is to occur in a real network scenario. According to the recommended encoding rates by YouTube \url{https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en#zippy=%2Cbitrate%2Cresolution-and-aspect-ratio},
% this issue would affect links with capacity of up to 24 or 30 Mbps for SDR and HDR for Full HD videos and up to 68 to 85 Mbps for Utra HD videos. However, most videos would be offered in up to 1080p quality as the users would not notice any difference than higher video, or the encoders did not produce it, or the network cannot support it (EU asking Netflix and Amazon to reduce their video quality because of COVID-19).


% We ported New CWV for linux kernel 5.4.x series. To verify that the port was successful, we compared the performance of the ported New CWV and the authors' New CWV implementation for kernel 3.18.2. In both cases, we emulated the network conditions and dataset from \cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash}. We then streamed that content on a Firefox client using dash.js's (v 3.1.3) throughput algorithm and we used nginx to serve the content.

\section{Discussion}

To verify whether New CWV's more accurate bandwidth estimations could improve playback stability, we would run three scenarios. Two with network link speed close to a representation requirement, and another sufficiently higher than a selected representation requirement.

In other words, if we have requirement of $R$ bits per second to support given representation $X$ where $X$ is not the lowest representation in the set. The current reference player behaviour is to start requesting $X$, as soon its average bandwidth estimate becomes $R/C_{bsf}$, where $C_{bsf}$ is the bandwidth safety factor (default 0.9). In this scenario, the more accurate bandwidth probes that New CWV might produce would mean that the player would start requesting $X$, sooner than it would if the connection was not using New CWV.

In specific, assume a video is encoded as shown in Table \ref{tab:video-requirements}. Then the average bandwidth estimate that the player would need to start requesting the 1080p representation would be 12.32 Mbps. Therefore, if we set the link speed at 13.55 ($12.32 + 10\% * 12.32$) we would expect the New CWV connection to attempt switching to the higher rate, whereas the non New CWV connection would keep requesting the 720p. Furthermore, for link speed of 14.78 ($12.32 + 20\%*12.32$), we would expect the New CWV to stably request the 1080p, whereas the non New CWV connection would be requesting a mix of 720 and 1080, depending on whether the average bandwidth probe exceeds 12.32 Mbps or not. Similarly, for link speed of 16.01 ($12.32 + 30\% 12.32$), we would expect both the New CWV enabled and the New CWV disabled connections to steadily request the higher 1080p representation. 

In this scenario, the values for the link speed and encoding representations are not important. Rather, they show a pattern relating to any scenario with similar $X$ and $T$ values. In other words, while we use a specific example to demonstrate a problem here, it may arise for any connection with link capacity of up to 100 Mbps. \\(\url{https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en#zippy=%2Cbitrate%2Cresolution-and-aspect-ratio})

\begin{itemize}
    \item New Transport ideas
    \item This chapter comes to the conclusion that while New CWV might be able to report more accurate results, in the scenarios for VoD streaming that we have today, they do not make a difference.
    \item However, if there was a proposal that promised an even more accurate bandwidth reporting, then the application could use that to better determine if representation $R$ is sustainable.
\end{itemize}

% Prior work evaluated New CWV against TCP Reno using a Linux kernel 3.14 implementation. Since then the Linux's Reno implementation has been a subject to both further optimisations (i.e., adoption of newer proposals) and API changes.

% A comparison of the current Reno implementation with a decade old New CWV would be unfair and the observed results might be due to improvements in Reno. To overcome this issue we provide a New CWV port for the most modern long term supported kernel of Linux (5.4). To verify that the port is success full and represent behaves as expected, we created 7 test-cases taken from RFC7661 and verify that our implementation behaves as documented.

% \section{Evaluation Metrics}

% % One aspect that was not considered with New CWV's proposal was its impact on the application layer. As discussed in chapter \ref{sec:background} the HTTP video streaming community have converged to a set of metrics that are considered most impactful for a stream's quality of experience. We believe that the lack of adoption of New CWV can be explained by a lack of increase in any of these metrics. \textbf{Claim: }In other words, standard Reno and New CWV should produce results of non significant difference.

% % To verify this claim, we compared the application layer results of Reno and New CWV. We used two network-data-set pairs for this experiment. For the first, we re-used the setup in \cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash}, for the second, we used video bit-rate encodings recommended by YouTube \cite{} and represnetative network trace that we picked from \textit{``Measuring Broadband America''} \cite{}.

% % Rk  , Bk and Ck represents the video bitrate, buffer occupancy and bandwidth capacity for chunk K respectively

% \subsection{Client's throughput probes}

% Since we assess that throughput algorithms that use New CWV as a transport should obtain more consistent results that closer match the effective available bandwidth, we collect all throughput samples reported by the client.


% Then, to evaluate the application-level performance we use the following metrics, used by both industry and research.

% \subsection{Average Bit-rate}

% The average video bit-rate is the sum of the bit-rates of all played-out chunks divided by their number. However, measuring bit-rate alone is not enough to estimate the QoE. For this reason additional metrics, described below are also considered. In addition, bit-rate improvement is not always proportional to an increase in QoE. For example a video representation changing from 1 to 2 Mbps, will achieve higher QoE than another stream changing from 10 to 11 Mbps, even though the bit-rate increase was the same \cite{Spiteri-2019-from-theory-to-practice-sabre}.

% \begin{equation*} \frac {1}{k}\sum _{k=1}^{K}q(R_{k}) \end{equation*}

% \subsection{Average Bit-rate oscillation}

% Mok et al show that frequent changes in the quality of the requested video is decremental to user's QoE \cite{Mok-2011-inferring-qoe}. The effective oscillation index can be computed using the average bit-rate oscillation formula. It measures the depth of the representation changes in the playout process. Proposals trying to optimise for this criterion exist \cite{Mok-2012-qdash, Huang-2012-confused-timid-qoe}.

% \begin{equation*} \frac {1}{K-1}\sum _{k=1}^{K-1}|q(R_{k+1})-q(R_{k)}| \end{equation*}

% \subsection{Startup delay \& Rebuffer Ratio} 

% Startup delay is the observed latency from when a video play request has been issued (e.g., user clicks the play button) to the first video frame starting to play-out. Rebuffer events occur when the video has no available buffered content and has to stop playing in order to fill in the buffers. This occurs when the media download time is higher than the playout buffer level. Research has shown that high startup delays or long rebuffer events could lead to users abandoning the video or watching less of it cite \cite{Krishnan-2012-video-stream-quality-impacts}.

% \begin{equation*} \sum _{k=1}^{K}\left ({\frac {d_{k}(R_{k})}{C_{k}}-B_{k}}\right)_{+} \end{equation*}

% \subsection{Metrics Summary}

% Striving for a single QoE metric has been an active research area. \cite{Yin-2015-a-control-theoritic-approach} aims to come up with a formula that uses the four metrics above, while \cite{Balachandran-2012-a-quest-for-internet-qoe} attempt to solve the problem by applying machine learning. However, no single such equation has been widely accepted. Instead, all work aiming to produce such equation relies on the same four metrics described above. 
% \cite{Dobrian-2013-understanding-the-impact-of-video-quality} classifies them as the industry standard. 

% \section{Evaluation}

% In order to obtain the metrics introduced in the previous chapter, we would need to stream a video over a period of time. During the play-out, results of the reported throughput would be collected.

% As an input for the experiment we would need to know how the network looks like, i.e.,
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item what is the available bandwidth for the link
%     \item what is the connection RTT
%     \item Does the bandwidth change?
% \end{enumerate}

% I think here we can take a look at three main cases with respect to the available bandwidth:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Link capacity is much more than the required bandwidth
%     \item Link capacity is close to one of the bandwidths required by the representation
%     \item Link capacity is between two different representation requirements.
% \end{enumerate}

% There was a study 2014 measuring Youtube's average RTT to be around 70, while netflix's 250. Stephen measured RTT to netflix of 50 yesterday so a value 50-70 ms is ``safe''.

% I expect New CWV controlled application to report results closer to the link capacity at all times. However, due to the current practices in modern DASH algorithms, that may not necessarily result in a higher quality as they tend to apply a safety factor on the obtained bandwidth result.

% To show how New CWV affects the application layer using the metrics explained above, we provide results from two network scenarios. The first, explained below re-uses the dataset and network properties as described in the original paper. The second one uses a more modern dataset, taken from youtube's video encoding recommendations and network traces derived from FCC's measuring broadband America 2018 study.

% This way we can verify how impactful New CWV was at the time of its introduction and we will be able to track if the same trend preserved over the years. In other words, we would verify whether the need of CWV is still relevant after almost a decade of evolution in both the network infrastructure and the transport protocols.

% \end{itemize}
% }

% We now show what application layer performance New CWV would have had compared to Reno if the original dataset and link properties were used with a modern throughput-based algorithm. 

% \begin{figure*}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/New CWV/cwnd_kernel.pdf}
%     \caption{Congestion Window Progression}
%     \label{fig:cwnd-reno-comparison}
% \end{figure*}

% Figure \ref{fig:cwnd-reno-comparison} compares the CWND evolution over time for Reno and New CWV. Since New CWV is based on Reno, we can see that during network-limited transfers they behave similar to one another (e.g., 100-400 second mark). Additionally New CWV does not grow its CWND to artificially large values during application-limited transfer. On the other hand, we can see Reno doing this after the 500th second mark. In other words, New CWV manages to keep the CWV more stable compared to Reno, by not overshooting its CWND value. In turn, this results in more consistent measurements at the client.

% \begin{figure*}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/New CWV/app_metrics.pdf}
%     \caption{Application Level Metrics}
%     \label{fig:app_metrics}
% \end{figure*}

% After seing that New CWV manages to shape the CWND of application-limited transfers to behave as "standard" TCP congestion window, we take a look at the application-layer performance. Figure \ref{fig:app_metrics} shows the start-up delay, average bit-rate, and bit-rate oscillation achieved during our simulations. The last bar-pair depicts the average values across all simulations. In Section \ref{sec:background} we covered the little New CWV adoption. The results, shown in Figure \ref{fig:app_metrics} could be one reason for this. Even though New CWV does provide lower start-up delay and bit-rate oscillation and higher average throughput, the demonstrated gain is not really statistically significant.


% \section{Future Work}

% \idea{New CWV does not help application layer throughput measuring functions to achieve higher precision. }

% New CWV does not show significantly different results from Reno. One way of improving this, would be by achieving lower average bit-rate oscillation. One way this could be achieved is by introducing TCP that leverages a steadier congestion window. This way, client algorithms measuring the throughput will be able to obtain rates that closer match the current network's capacity. In turn, this would lead to more consistent throughput measurements which are therefore less likely to request a rate that does not fully utilise the available bandwidth.

% While New CWV alone does not improve application's performance metrics or user's QoE. It has the correct approach in helping towards a possible improvement in that area. For example, if all results obtained by the application did not need to be validated and normalised, it could mean that applications are able to detect changes in the network more reliably and to react faster.

% The details
