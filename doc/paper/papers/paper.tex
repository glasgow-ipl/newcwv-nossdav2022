HTTP adaptive streaming video flows exhibit on-off behaviour, with frequent idle periods, which can interact poorly with TCP's congestion control algorithms. New Congestion Window Validation (New CWV) modifies TCP to allow senders to restart more quickly after certain idle periods. While previous work has shown that New CWV can improve \emph{transport} performance for streaming video, it remains to demonstrate that this translates to improved \emph{application} level performance, in terms of playback stability. In this paper, we show that enabling New CWV can reduce video re-buffering events by up to \todo{\%}, and limit representation switches by \todo{\%}, without any changes to existing
rate adaptation algorithms.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% A good paper introduction is fairly formulaic. If you follow a simple set
% of rules, you can write a very good introduction. The following outline can
% be varied. For example, you can use two paragraphs instead of one, or you
% can place more emphasis on one aspect of the intro than another. But in all
% cases, all of the points below need to be covered in an introduction, and
% in most papers, you don't need to cover anything more in an introduction.
%

Video streaming over HTTP is commonplace, and comprises the majority of Internet traffic~\cite{Sandvine-2019-global-internet-report}. Performance of HTTP adaptive streaming is generally good, and gives a high-quality user experience~\todo{\cite{..}}.
  
There remain, however, scenarios where HTTP adaptive streaming performs poorly~\cite{Spiteri-2016-BOLA,Kua-2017-a-survey-rate-adaptation-dash}. In particular, it has been observed that the interaction between the on-off traffic patterns generated by chunked streaming applications and TCP's congestion control algorithms reduces the performance of throughput-based rate adaptation schemes~\cite{Akhshabi-2012-http-adaptive-players-compete,Stohr-2017-where-are-the-sweet-spots-maci}. In some cases, this is due to TCP's Congestion Window Validation (CWV)~\cite{rfc2861-2000-padhye-congestion-window-validation} algorithm, which, while preventing TCP clients from sending using stale knowledge of the network, has been shown to negatively impact the throughput of rate-limited applications~\cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash-newcwv}, including HTTP adaptive streaming. New Congestion Window Validation (New CWV)~\cite{rfc7661-2015-fairhurst-new-cwnd-validation} has been proposed to address this. Prior work~\cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash-newcwv} has demonstrated that New CWV has the desired \emph{transport} layer impact, but it remains to show that this translates to improved QoE performance at the \emph{application} layer. This is not guaranteed, given the complexity that exists at both layers, and that results from their interaction. For example, large discrepancies between the video's bandwidth requirements and the available link capacity, or the requirement for stable, long-lived connections in modern streaming video players (e.g., dash.js~\todo{\cite{..}}), can influence rate adaptation~\cite{Spiteri-2019-from-theory-to-practice-sabre}.

% Paragraph 1: Motivation. At a high level, what is the problem area you
% are working in and why is it important? It is important to set the larger
% context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger
% community?

% Video playback stability is one of the key components contributing to user experience. Adaptive algorithms residing at the client are responsible for delivering high user experience. Some current state-of-the-art solutions use network throughput as a bitrate selection heuristic.

% Paragraph 2: What is the specific problem considered in this paper? This
% paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. In the first
% paragraph you have established general context and importance. Here you
% establish specific context and background.

% The adaptive algorithms face the difficult task of delivering video while picking its ``best'' representations at any given point in time. This is since these algorithms need to simultaneously fulfil multiple criteria including: high stability, high quality, and low video stalls. These criteria can often conflict one another. For example, an algorithm always picking the lowest available representation will achieve low video stall time and high stability (since representations will not fluctuate), however, it will also display lower video quality, whereas perhaps higher one was possible. In a dynamic network, achieving a high index on one of these criterion also comes at the cost of observing a lower index in another. Modern adaptive algorithms try to balance that trade-off. They use either the pre-buffered capacity at the client or the immediate network state as a heuristic to aid them in the decision process. The former algorithms are known as buffer and the latter as throughput based. 


% One way to influence the client's throughput calculations is to change the transport. Video over HTTP has to transfer many video chunks over the same connection. The time when between each such transfers, when no information is exchanged, is known as an ``idle period''. RFC 5861 recommends that during such periods TCP should adjust its congestion window back to its initial window value and re-enter slow start \cite{rfc5681-congeston-control}. New Congestion Window Validation \cite{rfc7661-2015-fairhurst-new-cwnd-validation} proposes a way for the congestion window value to remain unchanged during idle periods and connections using it do not need to re-enter slow start. These two approaches have different impact on the client's throughput calculations.


% However, different client throughput estimations does not necessarily mean improved video QoE. Video QoE is a complex variable that is a combination of different application metrics, e.g., average bitrate, average bitrate oscillation, and rebuffer ratio. As discussed earlier, improving one could come at the cost of worsening others. Therefore, the implications of a transport change are unclear with respect to the video's QoE or smoothness.


% Paragraph 3: "In this paper, we show that...". This is the key paragraph
% in the introduction - you summarize, in one paragraph, what are the main
% contributions of your paper, given the context established in paragraphs
% 1 and 2. What's the general approach taken? Why are the specific results
% significant? The story is not what you did, but rather:
%  - what you show, new ideas, new insights
%  - why interesting, important?
% State your contributions: these drive the entire paper.  Contributions
% should be refutable claims, not vague generic statements.

In this paper, we investigate whether enabling New CWV improves video playback stability, and more generally, improves video QoE. To test our hypothesis, we compare two video streams using TCP New Reno, one with New CWV disabled (i.e., with the current CWV algorithm) and one with it enabled. We collect standard video performance metrics, including bit-rate oscillation, and stall time, to measure stability and QoE. Further, to quantify the impact of New CWV with respect to the inferred network state at the client, we also record the immediate and smoothened client's current link capacity estimations for each delivered video chunk.% We carry our experiments using TCP New Reno, as previous study found that it is widely used for video delivery \cite{Mishra-2019-the-great-internet-tcp-congestion-control-census} and because New CWV is agnostic to the used congestion control algorithm.

\todo{concrete contributions: what did you find?}

% Paragraph 4: What are the differences between your work, and what others
% have done? Keep this at a high level, as you can refer to future sections
% where specific details and differences will be given, but it is important
% for the reader to know what is new about this work compared to other work
% in the area.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies New CWV's application layer impact. Nazir et al. \cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash-newcwv} demonstrated New CWV's effect on the transport layer, and we validate their results. There has been a large amount of work that has proposed new application layer rate adaptation algorithms~\cite{Mok-2012-qdash,Huang-2015-A-buffer-based-approach-to-rate-adaptation-bba, Yin-2015-a-control-theoritic-approach}. In contrast, we only change the transport algorithm and leave the application as is, studying the transport's impact on the application. Improving performance via transport layer modifications allows for simpler rate adaptation algorithms at the application layer. %Another proposal considers replacing the transport protocol from TCP to QUIC \cite{Bhat-2017-not-so-quic} but find that only doing this brings little to no benefit. 

% Paragraph 5: "We structure the remainder of this paper as follows." Give
% the reader a road-map for the rest of the paper. Try to avoid redundant
% phrasing, "In Section 2, In section 3, ..., In Section 4, ... ", etc.

We structure the remainder of this paper as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:background}, we introduce the core principals that motivate this paper, Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} describes our experimental setup. Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses the obtained results. Section~\ref{sec:related} describes related work, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\todo{Hand-crafted figure showing how CWND changes during slow-start after idle}

In HTTP adaptive streaming, a server provides pre-encoded video chunks at multiple bitrates, with the client, using a rate adaptation algorithm, determining the best representation to request at any given time. The goal of the client is to maximise QoE within the network's capacity. This is a challenge: different, often contradictory, QoE heuristics need be considered simultaneously~\cite{Seufert-2015-A-Survey-on-QoE-Dash}. 
% Furthermore, since HTTP streaming uses mainly TCP to transfer the chunks, the bit rate selection's algorithm complexity rises.

Throughput-based rate adaptation algorithms use an estimate of the current network conditions to determine the representation that should be requested. These algorithms require a stable and accurate estimate in order to perform well. However, the interaction between streaming video's on-off traffic pattern, and TCP's congestion control algorithms, can lead to significant fluctuations in throughput, impacting the performance of throughput-based adaptation algorithms.

%Previous work has identified that the interaction between TCP and HTTP can lead to poor link utilisation and perceived quality of experience for HTTP adaptive connections \cite{Bae-2015-why-is-http-streaming-hard,Esteban-2012-Interactions-HTTP-TCP}. One impeding performance aspect of the interaction between the two layers is related to the On-Off nature of the video traffic.

During idle periods, TCP's knowledge of the network's capacity becomes stale. Rather than making use of this knowledge when sending resumes, the Congestion Window Validation~\cite{rfc2861-2000-padhye-congestion-window-validation} algorithm resets TCP's congestion window (\texttt{cwnd}) to its original \todo{?} value, forcing the connection to resume sending in a slow-start phase. This has become standard practice~\cite{rfc5681-congeston-control}, and is enabled by default in the latest stable Linux kernel (version 5.4).

While this approach works well~\todo{\cite{..}} for bulk, network-limited applications, it is unsuitable for rate-limited applications, including HTTP adaptive streaming~\cite{Esteban-2012-Interactions-HTTP-TCP}. To address this, New Congestion Window Validation~\cite{rfc7661-2015-fairhurst-new-cwnd-validation} has been proposed. Rather than resetting the congestion window and forcing slow-start, New CWV preserves the congestion window's state after an idle period has been observed. 

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering
    \subfloat[CWV]{
      \includegraphics[width=.35\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{figures/lost_packets_vreno.pdf}
      \label{fig:transmission-after-idle-reno}

    \subfloat[New CWV]{

    }
    \caption{Resumption after an idle period \todo{different markers, larger font}}
    \label{fig:transmission-after-idle}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:transmission-after-idle} shows the impact of New CWV when resuming sending after an idle period. As shown, with CWV (Figure~\ref{fig:transmission-after-idle-reno}), the connection re-enters slow-start, doubling its send window until loss is observed, while with New CWV (Figure~\ref{fig:transmission-after-idle-newcwv}) reuses the prior congestion window size and only doubles its rate during the first three bursts, at which point it reaches its old congestion window value and proceeds in a congestion avoidance phase. Overall, this results in fewer lost packets, and a more consistent and predictable sending rate.

New CWV has been shown to improve the \emph{transport} layer performance of rate-limited applications when compared with CWV~\cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash-newcwv}. It remains to show how this translates into \emph{application} layer performance, particularly since this is not guaranteed~\cite{Spiteri-2016-BOLA}. We hypothesise that New CWV will enable applications to obtain more consistent throughput estimates, and, in turn, improve the stability of throughput-based rate adaptation algorithms.

\section{Evaluating New CWV for Video}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We first describe our experimental setup (\S\ref{sec:experimental-setup}), and use this to look at the impact on the transport layer, and measure the extent to which streaming applications using New CWV obtain more consistent throughput estimates (\S\ref{sec:transport-impact}). We then investigate how this transport behaviour impacts the application layer, and, more specifically, video QoE (\S\ref{sec:QoE-impact}). Finally,  we summarise our findings (\S\ref{sec:summary}).

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental-setup}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{figures/setup.pdf}
  \caption{Experimental Setup}
  \label{fig:experimental-setup}
\end{figure}

% Overview
Our evaluation testbed consists of an emulated network in Mininet, running on Ubuntu 20.04, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:experimental-setup}. Both the server and its clients use TCP New Reno, which is widely used for video delivery~\cite{Mishra-2019-the-great-internet-tcp-congestion-control-census}. In addition, both are running a modified Linux Kernel (5.4.0). The modifications include a version of New CWV ported to that kernel, alongside RFC 3339~\todo{\cite{..}}-compliant timestamps, to enable better event tracking, and more verbose \texttt{cwnd} event tracking. \texttt{tcpdump} is used at all endpoints to enable network activity to be reconstructed.

% Server
The server uses \texttt{nginx} (version 1.18), with HTTP/2 delivery enabled. The server provides three representations of Big Buck Bunny~\cite{online-bbb}, encoded at 480p (requiring bandwidth of 0.44Mbps), 720p (2.64Mbps), and 1080p (4.82Mbps). Each representation is provided in chunks that are 3 seconds in duration.

 %  Client
Each client uses Firefox (version 91) with the dash.js (version 4.0.0) player. While the current state-of-the-art rate adaptation algorithm is DYNAMIC~\cite{Spiteri-2019-from-theory-to-practice-sabre}, we opt to use the throughput algorithm for our experiments. DYNAMIC combines the throughput algorithm with an enhanced version of the BOLA algorithm~\cite{Spiteri-2016-BOLA}. By using the throughput algorithm, our evaluations focus on the impact that the transport layer has on throughput estimation at the application layer. Our findings are applicable to the DYNAMIC algorithm, especially in scenarios where the throughput algorithm operates (e.g., in low-latency, live streaming applications).

The network is configured a bottleneck RTT of 40ms, a reasonable value to emulate connections within the UK. The routers' queues are set equal to the bandwidth delay product. Three different bandwidth profiles are evaluated, representing DSLv2 (10Mbps), FTTC (50Mbps), and FTTP (145Mbps) links in the UK~\cite{online-ofcom-report}.

To evaluate the impact of congestion and competing flows, each simulation was run with multiple clients (1, 2, 3, and 5 clients) simultaneously requesting video. Finally, to reduce noise, we ran each combination of CWV or New CWV, number of clients, and link type, 10 times before reporting the average results. The dataset presented includes data accumulated from 240 simulations (\emph{2 algorithms $\times$ 3 link types $\times$ 4 client variations $\times$ 10 repetitions}). 

During each run we collect the client's bandwidth estimations. Additionally, to evaluate the video QoE impact we collect information to report average bitrate, average bitrate oscillation, and re-buffer ratio, given that these are standard video metrics directly related to the user's QoE \cite{Spiteri-2019-from-theory-to-practice-sabre, Yin-2015-a-control-theoritic-approach, Dobrian-2013-understanding-the-impact-of-video-quality}.

\subsection{Impact on Transport Performance} 
\label{sec:transport-impact}

New CWV alters the CWND sizing behaviour, allowing it to recover faster, after an idle period in an active TCP connection. Therefore, we expect the client to report more stable values regarding the available link bandwidth. 

To evaluate our hypothesis, we collect two of the client's available bandwidth measurements. The first is the raw estimate obtained by dividing the number of received bytes over the download time. The second, estimation is what gets fed to the throughput algorithm. This value is a function of the current measurement probe, already explained, and additional factors such as, historical capacity data, ``safety" factors, etc. In short, the former is the raw available bandwidth measurement as seen by the client, and the latter is what gets fed to the throughput algorithm. We call the former ``instantaneous" and the latter ``smoothened" estimate. These values are shown in Figure \ref{fig:throughput-clients}.

Figure \ref{fig:throughput-clients} validates the behaviour where New CWV is enabled reported by \cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash-newcwv}. That is, New CWV's CDF has a steeper gradient. This supports our initial hypothesis that the streaming clients measuring the available bandwidth will be able to obtain more consistent results since the amount of lost packets is reduced (Figure \ref{fig:transmission-after-idle}), or otherwise the goodput is increased. Moreover, it can be seen that the different resumption after idle policy resulted in lower overall available bandwidth measurements. This is since when New CWV is enabled, connections will not hit the available capacity cap as fast. However, this pre-emptive mechanism allows for higher consistency on links where nearly all of the available bandwidth is used (FTTC scenarios in Figure \ref{fig:throughput-clients}).

However, our packet loss results (Figure \ref{fig:transmission-after-idle}) differ from those reported by \cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash-newcwv}. They have observed similar loss values both when New CWV is enabled and when it is disabled. However, we observe that when disabled, connections lose more packets at a rate close to 1:10 compared to when enabled. Figure \ref{fig:transmission-after-idle}, shows the transfer patterns for a video chunk after an idle period. For readability, we have shown the slow-start period of a single video chunk download, but it applies to any such transfer. It can be seen that when New CWV is absent the majority of the packets lost are near the end of the slow-start period when the CWND size allows for transferring data beyond the link's capacity. In contrast, since New CWV only enters slow-start with an upper bound of its previously known window value, New CWV is able to enter congestion avoidance faster without losing packets as a result of a large CWND value. This explains the higher loss values that we have observed.

\subsection{Impact on Video QoE}
\label{sec:QoE-impact}

We next look at the QoE impact of the discussed earlier bandwidth values obtained when New CWV is active. To measure the QoE difference we collect standard video QoE metrics, namely, oscillations, and rebuffer ratio. Additionally, we look at the absolute difference in requested video encodings. For brevity, we have omitted the FTTP results from Figures \ref{fig:avg-oscillations}, \ref{fig:rebuffer-ratio}, and \ref{fig:bitrate-switches} as in all of these cases the FTTP connections did not see any stability issues, i.e., no rebuffering events and downloaded encodings at the maximum possible rate.

Figure \ref{fig:avg-oscillations}, shows that when using New CWV connections observe lower bit-rate oscillation. Lower oscillation is associated with a higher QoE index, as frequent representation switches are found decremental to the QoE \todo{\cite{}}. We note that in some cases with a restricted link capacity and multiple clients (e.g., 3 clients on a DSL link), connections that do not use New CWV may request higher video encodings. However, it can be seen that the network cannot support these higher encoding chunks consistently. Evident by the higher oscillation the connections achieve in those cases. A similar pattern is seen with respect to the rebuffer ratio (Figure \ref{fig:rebuffer-ratio}). In other words, the inconsistent available bandwidth values seen by the application layer for connections that do not use New CWV immediately following the resumption after idle behaviour can trick the adaptive algorithm in requesting video chunks that cannot be supported by the network which in turn increases the oscillations and rebuffering. Thus hindering the overall QoE.


Furthermore, Figure \ref{fig:bitrate-switches} provides additional bitrate switch frequency data. For brevity, we have only shown the DSL case, as for the FTTC and FTTP there was little to no encoding derivation. We show the absolute encoding difference between every played video chunk and its subsequent one. For example, if both played video chunks were of the same encoding their difference absolute difference is zero. If the subsequent chunk is of the next higher encoding their difference is +1, and if it is of the next lower encoding the difference is -1, etc. Reusing the 3 clients example, we see that connections without New CWV experience quality switches for 13\% of their requested chunks, whereas connections with New CWV experience 7\%. That 6\% accounts for over 18 seconds of longer video stability achieved by New CWV.

From our experiments so far, we conclude that New CWV achieves higher video stability when multiple clients are competing on a constrained link. This stability comes in the form of lower overall bit-rate or otherwise lower average picture quality but with improved encoding stability and decreased rebuffering time. We have observed this behaviour mainly on the simulated DSL link, since our highest video encoding is just under 5Mbps, but in practice higher encodings are also used. \todo{\cite{}}.

\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

So far, we have validated the throughput reports in \cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash-newcwv} (Fig \ref{fig:throughput-clients}) and observed higher packet loss for connections not using New CWV (Fig \ref{fig:transmission-after-idle}). Furthermore, the presented results confirm our initial hypothesis that New CWV's more persistent bandwidth measurements as observed in \ref{fig:throughput-clients} translate to more consistent representation switches, shown by the lower bit-rate derivative variance for New CWV connections (Figure \ref{fig:bitrate-switches}). Finally, we have also observed that the more consistent measurements better match the available network conditions, allowing clients using New CWV to better predict the network's capabilities and request chunks that can be timely delivered. This is shown by the lower stall time for New CWV connections (Figure \ref{fig:rebuffer-ratio}).

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

In Section \ref{sec:evaluation}, we saw that New CWV improves video stability by sacrificing some rendered picture quality for links with restrained capacities and multiple clients. We also, observed that when the there is sufficient link capacity to satisfy the most demanding representation, as expected the rendered quality is high and there are no stability issues. In other words, if the network resources are oversupplied with regard to the highest video requirement, there are no issues.  However, if the client is able to download at rate over the highest representation requirement, then whether the download happens 20\% or 50\% faster, makes no significant impact. The only real benefit is that the buffers at the client would fill quicker. Therefore, clients can potentially impose a maximum limit to their desired download rate and leave the rest of the link unused for other flows.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

New CWV enhances the previous validation \cite{rfc2861-2000-padhye-congestion-window-validation}. Similar to its predecessor it solves the issue of invalidating the TCP state, after the TCP transfer was application and not network limited but it does so in a more network friendly way, without the need to re-enter slow-start and lose packets to gauge the available link's capacity. That is, New CWV alters TCP's send-rate. The idea of changing TCP's rate is not new, an idea proposed in the late 90s suggests how TCP rate can be modelled as a function of packet loss \cite{Mathis-1997-the-macroscopic-behavior-tcp}. Another proposal \cite{Padhye-1998-modelling-tcp-throughput} refines that idea later. This way of defining TCP friendliness and predicting rate behaviours have in turn been used as basis in different protocol proposals \cite{rfc-5348-tfrc,Rossi-2010-ledbat,Arun-2018-copa} and other multimedia oriented ones \cite{Carlucci-2016-Analysis-WebRTC,Choi-2007-fairer-tfrc}.


Additionally, after the MPEG-DASH video standard, work on improving the performance of adaptive algorithms has resurged. During that time, three main concepts for adaptive algorithms have been proposed: throughput based \cite{Sun-2016-cs2p, Jiang-2012-improving-fairness-http-video-festive}, buffer based \cite{Spiteri-2016-BOLA,Huang-2015-A-buffer-based-approach-to-rate-adaptation-bba}, and hybrid \cite{Spiteri-2019-from-theory-to-practice-sabre,Wang-2016-squad}. Rate based solutions \cite{Li-2014-probe-and-adapt-panda,Liu-2011-rate-adaptation} have also been proposed, but as of the time of writing this paper have not made it to the reference de-facto standard DASH implementation.


As different adaptation algorithms were proposed, the need of metrics to evaluate and compare them arose. Early research provided metrics to evaluate the perceived QoE \cite{Cranley-2006-user-perception-adapting-video}. However, later \cite{Balachandran-2012-quest-for-internet-video-qoe} argued that no single combination of low-level metrics can provide a good QoE score for measuring video. Since then, QoE defining research relied on modelling and predictive patterns, however, a single agreed upon metric to measure to QoE has still not been found. Nevertheless, regardless of the metrics used, the gains that a single adaptation strategy can offer have reached a point of diminishing returns. This is supported by the volume of proposals on adaptive algorithms that are being published. However, we have still identified cases where the current best practices fail to perform well (e.g., constrained links with multiple clients). Additionally, we have shown that changes in the transport layer can help these cases, without using different application algorithms. Therefore, we argue that future work in the area might benefit from looking at improving the transport behaviour again.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we showed that New CWV's resumption after idle policy leads to improved video playback stability. We compared video delivery with and without New CWV and validated the results shown by previous work \cite{Nazir-2014-performance-evaluation-congestion-window-validation-dash-newcwv}. We reported video delivery scenarios using emulated links representative for the commodity of last-mile links found in the UK and examined scenarios with different numbers of clients. Future work might look at the performance of these algorithms under more dynamic environments, for example if all clients join the session at random times or in the presence of other cross-traffic.
